			<div class="aboutleft">
				Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987. Founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt
				Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, the band went through a succession of drummers before recruiting Dave Grohl in 1990.
				Nirvana's success popularized alternative rock, and they were often referenced as the figurehead band of Generation X.
				Their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock and roll culture.

			<div class="aboutright">
				Nirvana's musical style has been mainly described as grunge,[104][105] alternative rock,[106][107] punk rock,[108] and
				hard rock.[67] Characterized by their punk aesthetic, Nirvana fused pop melodies with noise.[67] Billboard described
				their work as a "genius blend of Kurt Cobain's raspy voice and gnashing guitars, Dave Grohl's relentless drumming and
				Krist Novoselic's uniting bass-work that connected with fans in a hail of alternately melodic and hard-charging
				songs".[109]
